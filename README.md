Applied RCDT techniques to preprocess and analyze Affine MNIST dataset images, medical imaging data from the IQ-OTH/NCCD lung cancer dataset, and Brain Tumor Scans. Enhanced classification performance by combining RCDT-based features with the Nearest Subspace
classifier and advanced machine learning models like SVM and Neural Networks like CNN.
